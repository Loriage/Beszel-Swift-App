## Installation

<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/beszel/id6747600765"><img src="https://tools.applemediaservices.com/api/badges/download-on-the-app-store/black/en-us?size=250x83&amp;releaseDate=1712361600" alt="Download on the App Store" style="border-radius: 13px; width: 200px; height: 66px;"></a>

### Alternative Methods

-   Sideload the `.ipa` from [releases](https://github.com/Loriage/Beszel-Swift-App/releases/latest)

## Known Issues

### Widgets on Sideloaded App

The Home Screen widgets will not function if you install the app by sideloading the .ipa file. This is a known limitation due to iOS security policies, as sideloading prevents the widget from securely sharing data and credentials with the main app through the required App Group.
For the best experience, including widget support, please download the official version from the App Store.
